# World_Weather_Analysis
## Python project on cities, hotels, and weather

### Repurposing the code from the module, this project has three aims: __1)__ Add weather description to the weather data we previously retrieved through the OpenWeatherMap API. __2)__ Get user input to produce travel destinations and hotel suggestions reflecting the weather preferences of the user. __3)__ Use Google Maps Directions API to create an itinerary between four cities selected and to draw a marker layered map.
